                    The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus.
                     The CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. They include: 
Wash your hands often with plain soap and water. The CDC recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing masks in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Effective February 2, 2021, masks are required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into
, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations.

                    People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. 
                    People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency
                     such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. Never take 
                    a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.On October 22, 2020, the FDA approved the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) 
                    for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.

                    COVID-19 has a higher rate of severe disease and mortality in nearly every age group, 
                    compared with influenza (flu).
                    John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reported that “COVID-19 has killed more people in the US 
                han flu has in the last five years.”
                   In the UK, data revealed that between January-August, COVID-19 killed 3.4 times as many people in 2020 than
                  flu and pneumonia combined.
                The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that in the United States flu has resulted 
                in “between 12,000-61,000 deaths annually since 2010.” 
                COVID-19 has resulted in more than 304,000 deaths in the US.

                    The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing 
                    your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and water for
                     at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after 
                     coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available,
                     CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

                    COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and produced in record time, but it’s also involved unprecedented 
                    levels of funding and global cooperation to tackle a global threat. So far,
                     all approved COVID-19 vaccines have undergone large clinical trials with rigorous safety protocols, 
                     and without major safety concerns raised.
                    The COVAX Facility – co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and 
                    the World Health Organization (WHO) – has incentivised vaccine manufacturers to scale-up and manufacture 
                    high volumes before the vaccines are licensed. This is known as manufacturing at risk but it means that
                     vaccines can be
                     rolled out as soon as they are approved, avoiding years of delay.

                  Mask wearing is a very simple and effective way to reduce transmission and save lives. The degree of
                   protection depends on the type of mask, how well 
                  hey worn and on other factors such as the behaviour of people wearing them and the behaviour
                   of air
                   droplets in different settings.
                   Masks alone are not enough to fully protect someone from the virus, but they still have an 
                   essential role to play 
                    in protecting high risk individuals, such as frontline health care workers.

                Even though regularly washing your hands is very important, as with masks it is not enough on
                 its own. Public health guidelines
                 all work in tandem to prevent the spread of germs.
                Keep washing your hands for at least 20 seconds each time, keep carrying antibacterial gel when you’re travelling 
                 and remember to wear a mask and practice physical distancing.

              Search for keywords like ‘fit,’ ‘healthy’ and ‘COVID’ and you will see countless headlines referring to people who have died or suffered from
               severe symptoms despite being otherwise healthy. 
              So even if you are less at risk due to your age or BMI, that doesn’t guarantee that you won’t suffer from 
              long-term symptoms like breathlessness, fatigue, a loss of smell and/or taste.
               A research paper on COVID-19-related mortality among US adults aged 25-44 revealed that in July 2020 almost 
             12,000 more deaths were recorded than normally expected, based on historical norms. This led to July being described as
              the deadliest month for this age group in 20 yearsEven if you are fit and healthy, you could spread the
               infection to vulnerable people, such as older people or those with compromised immune systems or diabetes. Taking steps to safeguard against 
              COVID-19 will not only protect you, but also others around you.

           They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily:

            Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;
